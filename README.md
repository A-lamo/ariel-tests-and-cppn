# Ariel: Autonomous Robots through Integrated Evolution and Learning

## Notes

### Units

To ensure that Revolve 3 uses a consistent set of units for all simulations, we use [SI units](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/International_System_of_Units), and (astropy)[https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html] to enforce it (we automatically convert where we can).

For more information, see: [astropy: units and quantities](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html) and [astropy: standard units](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/standard_units.html#standard-units).
