Notes:
    *  Okay, I get it, no abstractions we said, but listen for a second, when I wrote this code I had the following idea in mind: at the simplest level, we will be running the simulations with pre-generated XML files, that is much faster than generating them on the fly.
        Now, lets assume we do run the 'generate' functions, there is only a small set of reasons why you may want to do that (that I can think of):
        1. You changed the default parameters and you need a new XML.
        2. You are generating parametric modules(eg. evolving bricks with different sizes).
        With the former, the only thing you need to do is simply change the default values.
        With the latter, it's good practice to use a standard API such that you can easily apply the evolve parameters.
        If you need something REALLY different, you probably shouldn't be using the Robogen Lite folder. You should either create a new set of modules, or work directly with MujoCo MjSpec.
        Also, in Revolve 2 the units where going absolutely everywhere, this is the easiest and most elegant solution I could think of.
